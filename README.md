I have created a website which conduct a quiz of subject HTML for user ,the basic structure is defined by html
and the design of website styled by CSS and the function are defined by JavaScript.
There are two sectors in this websites one is questions and other is result page ,there are three functions
loadquiz(),chechanswer(),endquiz(),loadquiz function load the question with options from the question array
and after the answer is selected the checkanswer function check the selected answer with correct answer given
in array using if statement if correct added one to the score .after all the questions are shown.
After all question are shown the endquiz is called and result page is loaded and the score are displayed.
